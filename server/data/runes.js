For if the ancient principle 'As above so below' is true, then we are also here to nourish God. This is a Rune that calls for a deep probing of the meaning of profit and gain in your life. Look with care to know whether it is wealth and possessions you require for your well-being, or rather self-rule and the growth of a will. Another concern of Fehu is with conserving what has already been gained. It urges vigilance and continual mindfulness, especially in times of good fortune, for it is then that we are likely to collapse ourselves into our success on the one hand, or to behave recklessly on the other. Enjoy your good fortune and remember to share it; the mark of a well-nourished self is the ability to nourish others.",

You may have to sit helplessly by and watch while what you've gained starts to dwindle away. Observe what is happening. Examine the negativity from an open perspective and ask, 'What lesson do I need to learn from this in my life?' Even if there is occasion for joy, do not be se- duced into mindless joyousness. Reversed, Fehu indicates that doubtful situations are abundant and come in many forms and guises. You are being put in touch with the shadow side of possessions. Yet all this is part of the coming to be and passing away, and is not that which abides. In dealing with the shadow side, you have an opportunity to recognize where your true nourishment lies."},

        normal:  "The Rune of termination and new beginnings. Drawing it indicates that the life you have been living has outgrown its form, which must die so that life energy can be released in a new birth, a new form. Uruz is a Rune of passage and, as such, part of the Cycle of Self-Transformation. Positive growth and change, however, may involve passage into darkness as part of the cycle of perpetual renewal. As in Nature, the progression consists of five parts: death, decay, gestation, germination, rebirth. Events occurring now may well prompt you to undergo a death within yourself. Since self-change is never coerced—we are always free to resist—remain mindful that the new form, the new life, is always greater than the old. Prepare, then, for opportunity disguised as loss. It could involve the loss of someone or something to which there is an intense emotional bond, and through which you are living a part of your life, a part that must now be retrieved so you can live it out for yourself. Now, in some way, that bond is being severed, a relationship radically changed, a death experienced. Seek among the ashes and discover a new perspective and a new birth. The original meaning of this symbol was 'a wild ox' (the aurochs). When the wild ox was domesticated—a nearly impossible task—it could transport heavy loads. Learn to adapt yourself to the demands of such a creative time. Firm principles attach to this Rune, and at the same time humility is called for since in order to rule you must learn how to serve. This Rune puts you on notice that your soul and the universe support the new growth.",

It may seem that your own strength is being used against you. For some, this Rune Reversed will serve to alert,providing clues in the form of minor failures and disappointments. For Reversed, it calls for some serious thoughts about the quality of your relationship to your Self.  But take heart. Remember the constant cycling of death and rebirth, the endless going and return. Everything we experience has a beginning, a middle, and end, and is followed by a new beginning. Therefore do not draw back from the passage into darkness. When in deep water, become a diver."},

The Spirit of Transformation guards the gate of the personal world, looking out as well as in, symbolizing the abiding urge to transcend the limits of the little self. The gateway is at once a portal and a frontier between Heaven and the mundane. Arriving here is a recognition of your readiness to contact the numinous, the Divine, to illuminate your experience so that its meaning shines through its form. Thurisaz is a Rune of non-action. The gateway is not to be approached and passed through without contemplation. Here you are being confronted with a true reflection of what is hidden in yourself, what must be exposed and examined before successful ac- tion can be undertaken. This Rime's strength lies in its ability to wait. This is not a time to take decisions. Deep transformational forces are at work in this next to last of the Cycle Runes. Visualize a gateway on a hilltop. Your entire life lies behind you and below. Before you pass through, pause and review the past: the learning and the joys, the tests and tribulations, all that it took to bring you here. Bless it, and release it all. For in so doing you reclaim what is truly yours—your power in the universe.Step through the gateway now.",

Be certain that you are not suffering over your suffering. Once again, consider the uses of adversity. Hasty decisions at this time may cause regrets, for the probability is that you will act from weakness, deceive yourself about your motives and create new problems more severe than those you are at- tempting to resolve. Impulses must be tempered by thought for correct procedure. Keep still and collect yourself, wait on the Tao, the Will of Heaven — nothing else is timely now. Do not attempt to go beyond where you haven't yet begun. Enforced contemplation is the essence of this Rune Reversed. Drawing it indicates a quickening of your development. Yet even when the growth process accelerates there will be halts along the way to reconsider, to integrate. Take advantage of these halts."},

XXX  The message may be that of a new life unfolding. New lives begin with new connections, surprising linkages that direct us into new pathways. Take pains to be especially aware and conscious during meetings, visits, chance encounters, particularly with persons wiser than yourself. A sense of new family solidarity invests Ansuz. XXX Through association with the Norse god Loki, Mercury overshadows this Rune. In mythology a strange, androgynous figure, keeper of the keys to knowledge, Mercury carried messages between the gods and between gods and humanity. In him is   symbolized the urge to integrate unconscious motive with conscious recognition. Drawing this Rune tells you - connection with the Divine is at hand. XXX This Rune is a signal to explore the depths, the foundations of life, and to experience the inexhaustible wellspring of the Divine in your nature.

        normal: "This Rune is concerned with communication, with the attunement of something that has two sides, two elements, and with the ultimate reunion that comes as the end of the journey when what is above and what is below are united and of one mind. The journey is the soul's journey. Moreover, the approach of that which is above and that which is below is realized from inmost sentiment rather than through the force of circumstances. A simple prayer for the soul's journey is: 'I will to will Thy will' Such a simple form of prayer is proper, it seems, on almost any occasion. It is a suitable preamble, in particular, to healing. Raido is another of the Runes in the Cycle of Self-Transformation. Inner worth mounts here, and at such a time we must remember that we are not intended to rely entirely upon our own power, but instead to ask what is right action. Ask through prayer, through addressing your own knowing, your body knowing, the Witness Self, the Teacher Within. Once you are clear, then you can neutralize your refusal to let right action flow through you. Not intent on movement, be content to wait. While you wait, keep on removing resistances. As the obstructions give way, all remorse arising from 'trying to make it happen' disappears. As always, the journey is toward self-healing, self-change and union. You are concerned here with nothing less than unobstructed, perfect union. But the union of Heaven and Earth cannot be forced. Keep within your limits. Regulate any excesses in your life. Material advantages must not weigh heavily on this journey of the self toward the Self. Trust your own Process—that is the essence of this Rune. Keep on cutting away illusions. Stand apart even from like-minded others; the notion of strength in numbers does not apply at this time, for this part of the journey cannot be shared. Innermost feeling, spontaneously expressed, is the only right action now. This Rune urges you to undertake your journey, your quest—and if you have already begun, to continue.",

Kano is the Rune for the morning of activities, for seriousness, clarity and concentration, all of which are essential at the beginning of work. The protection offered by this Rune is that the more light you have, the better you can see what is trivial and outmoded in your conditioning. In relationships, there can now be a mutual opening up. You may serve as the trigger, the timekeeper, through your awareness that the light of understanding is once again available to you both. Recognize that, while on the one hand you are limited and dependent, on the other you exist at the perfect center where the harmonious and beneficent forces of the universe merge and radiate.

At all levels — in love relationships, in business matters, in partnering of every kind — this counsel applies particularly when you enter into partnership with the Higher Self.

This is an alchemical moment in which understanding is transmuted from knowledge.

Joyousness accompanies new energy, energy blocked before now. Light pierces the clouds and touches the waters just as something lovely emerges from the depths.

Drawing it indicates a pressing need within the psyche to break free from constricting identification with material reality and to experience the world of archetypal mind. Hagalaz is the Rune of elemental disruption, of events totally beyond your control. Although it has only an Upright position, it always operates through reversal. When you draw this Rune, expect disruption of your plans, for it is the great 'Awakener,' although the form the awakening takes may vary. Perhaps you will experience a gradual feeling of coming to your senses, as though you were emerging from a long sleep. Then again, the onset of power may be such as to rip away the fabric of what you previously knew as your reality, your security, your understanding of yourself, your work, your relationships and beliefs. Be aware, however, that what operates here is not ultimately an outside force, not a situation of you-at-the-mercy-of-externals. Your own nature is creating what's happening, and you are not without power in this situation. The inner strength you have funded until now in your life is your support and guide at a time when everything you've taken for granted is being challenged.

But you are forewarned and, therefore, encouraged to understand and accept what occurs as necessary, called for in your deeps out of a pressing need for growth. There is nothing trivial about this Rune. The more severe the disruption in your life, the more significant and timely the requirements for your growth.

Usually ha requires a sacrifice of the personal, the 'I.' And yet there is no reason for anxiety.

This Rune is on the side of Heaven, the Unknowable, and has associations with the phoenix, that mystical bird that consumes itself in the fire and then rises from its own ashes. Its ways are secret and hidden. Deep inner transformational forces are at work here. Yet what is achieved is not easily or readily shared. An integrity is involved that may be masked,disguised or secret. After all, becoming whole, the means of it, is a profound secret On the side of the earthly or mundane, there may well be surprises; unexpected gains are not unlikely. On the side of human nature, this Rime is symbolized by the flight of the eagle. Soaring flight, free from entanglement, lifting yourself above the endless ebb and flow of ordinary life to acquire broader vision—all this is indicated here. This is the Rune of question. Another of the Cycle Runes, Perth signifies an intense aspect of initiation. Nothing external matters here, except as it shows you its inner reflection. This Rune is concerned with the deepest stratum of being, with the bedrock on which your fate is founded. For some, Perth means experiencing a psychic death. If need be, let go of everything, no exceptions, no exclusions. Nothing less than renewal of the Spirit is at stake.",

Reversed, this Rune puts you on notice to call in your scattered energies and concentrate on your own life at this moment, your own requirements for growth. More important, this Rune counsels you not to focus on outcomes, or to bind yourself with the memory of past achievements; in so doing, you rob yourself of a true present which is the only time in which self-change can be realized. You may feel overwhelmed with exhaustion from meeting obstruction upon obstruction in your passage. Yet you always have a choice, you can see all this apparent negativity as 'bad luck' or you can recognize it as an obstacle course, a challenge peculiar to the initiation you are presently undergoing. Then each setback, each humiliation becomes a test of character. When your inner being is shifting and reforming on a deep level, patience, constancy and perseverance are called for.

It embodies the impulse toward self-realization and indicates the path you must follow, not from ulterior motives but from the essence of your individuality. Seeking after wholeness is the heart of the Warrior's quest. And yet what you are striving to become in actuality is what you already are in essence: it is your personal myth, that which you are to make conscious, bring into form, express in a creative way. The sun symbolizes the path and illuminates the goal, which is the human heart. A Rune of great power, making life force available to you, Sowelu marks a time for recharging and regeneration right down to the cellular level. You may actually experience power surges, for the energies involved can be drastic. Although this Rune has no Reversed position, there is reason for caution. You may even see fit to withdraw, to retreat in the face of a pressing situation, especially if events or people are demanding that you 'spend' your energy now. Know that such a retreat is a retreat in strength, and that it can mark a voyage inward for centering, for balance. Timely retreat is among the skills of the Spiritual Warrior. At the same time, for some, this Rune counsels opening yourself up, letting the Light into some part of your life that has been secret, shut away. To accomplish this may call for profound recognitions, for admitting to yourself something that you have long denied. There is a prayer known as the Gayatri that embodies the spirit of this Rune. Address the sun in this fashion: 'You, who are the source of all power, Whose rays illuminate the whole world, Illuminate also my heart So that it too can do your work.' While reciting the Gayatri, visualize the sun's rays streaming forth into the world, entering your own heart, and then streaming out of your heart center in turn. This is an extremely powerful and life-enhancing prayer. Again, there is a caution not to give yourself airs. Yet, even in a time of bountiful energy, you are required to face and vanquish your refusal to let right action flow through you. Nourish this capacity, for it is your true function. Aim yourself truly and maintain your aim without manipulation. Practice the art of not forcing. Aim yourself truly and then maintain your aim without manipulative effort. Meditate on Christ's words: 'I can of mine own self do nothing'. For in our own power, we do nothing; even in loving, it is Love that loves through us. This way of thinking and being integrates new energies and permits you to flow into wholeness, which is the ultimate realization of your personal myth, and the goal of the Spiritual Warrior.",

Embodied in this Rune is the energy of discrimination, the swordlike quality that enables us to cut away the old, the dead, the extraneous. With this Rune comes the certain knowledge that the universe always has the first move. Patience is the virtue of this Rune, and it recalls for us the words of St. Augustine that 'The reward of patience is patience.' The molding of character is the issue when this Rune appears in your spread. Here, you are asked to look within, to delve down to the foundations of your life itself. Only in so doing can you hope to deal with the deepest needs of your nature and to tap into your most profound resources. Associated with the Rune are the sun, yang energy, the active principle. The urge toward conquest is prominent here, especially self-conquest, which is a lifelong pursuit and calls for awareness, single-mindedness and the willingness to undergo your passage without anxiety and in total trust. When Teiwaz comes in response to a question about romantic attachment, it indicates that the relationship is both timely and providential. The bond is to a partner with whom you resonate; there is work for you to do together. If the issue relates to your devotion to a cause, an idea, a path of conduct, the Warrior Rune counsels perseverance, although, at times, the kind of perseverance called for is patience. What are your priorities? How are you using your energy? Teiwaz is a Rune of courage and dedication. In ancient times it was this glyph that warriors painted on their shields before battle.

Are you focused on outcomes rather than on the activity for its own sake? This is not a matter on which to seek outside advice. Keep your own counsel.

Personal moral effort and persevering steadfastness are called for when you draw this Rune. Let it be said this way: 'As I cultivate my nature, all else follows.' A horse is the Rune-symbol because it progresses gradually. From Bronze Age artifacts we find the sun linked to the horse; the horse both symbolized the sun and was regarded as drawing it across the sky.

That is implicit here. And yet do not be closed, or narrow, or judging. Remain receptive to impulses flowing from the Divine within and without. Here you might contemplate the words from Hamlet: 'To thine own self be true' And these words, too, may be contemplated: strive to live the ordinary life in a non-ordinary way.
